# Platform

## When to Use
Work that targets a platform surface rather than a generic component: mobile-native patterns and PWA, React Native/Expo, internationalization and RTL, SEO and metadata, Stripe payments, transactional email, AI chat/streaming UI, background-job and agent-status interfaces.

## Stack
React 19 · Next.js App Router · Expo (RN) · next-intl · Stripe · React Email + Resend · Vercel AI SDK

## Core Rules
1. **Mobile is not a narrow desktop** — and desktop is not a wide phone. Bottom tab nav for primary navigation, bottom sheets over centre modals, pull-to-refresh where a list is the content, `env(safe-area-inset-*)` on anything full-bleed. On a pointer surface, none of those four transfer: see `references/desktop-patterns.md`.
2. **Responsive web layout reflows, it does not just shrink.** `min-width` media queries for progressive enhancement, not `max-width` cascading down from desktop. Grids stack to one column below 640px (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`); wide tables get a horizontal-scroll container below 768px rather than squashed columns; nav collapses to a hamburger below 768px. Touch-target sizing (rule 3) applies at every width — a mouse cursor is not permission to shrink a target back down on desktop. Test at 390px, 768px, 1024px and 1440px, not just one desktop viewport. `min-h-[100dvh]` on the root; reserve `min-h-[100svh]` for scroll-driven containers that must not resize under the mobile URL bar.
3. **Touch targets ≥44×44px** with ≥24px spacing; `touch-action: manipulation`; `overscroll-behavior: contain` in sheets and drawers. 44 is the house rule and WCAG §2.5.5 (AAA); the AA floor in §2.5.8 is 24×24 and applies only to pointer-only chrome.
4. **React Native is a different renderer, not different rules.** `SafeAreaView`, `Pressable` (never a bare `TouchableOpacity` for primary actions), `FlatList` with `keyExtractor`, Reanimated for motion, 44pt targets, dark mode via `useColorScheme`.
5. **i18n from the start.** `next-intl` routing, ICU messages, `Intl.*` for dates/numbers/currency, RTL via CSS logical properties (never `margin-left`), copy expansion budget of ~30% for German.
6. **SEO is structural.** Next.js metadata API, Open Graph, JSON-LD, sitemap and robots, canonical URLs, and Core Web Vitals as the ranking-relevant part — LCP image `priority`, no CLS from unsized media.
7. **Payments.** Stripe PaymentElement over hand-built card fields, Appearance API for brand match, error handling by decline code, webhooks for truth (never trust the client), saved methods behind explicit consent.
8. **Email is a different CSS universe.** Tables for layout, inline styles, no flex/grid, ~600px width, dark-mode-safe colours, plain-text alternative, tested across clients.
9. **AI chat UI.** Stream tokens, keep a stop control, autoscroll only when the user is at the bottom, announce completion via `aria-live`, surface tool calls rather than hiding them.
10. **Long-running work needs status, not spinners** — progress, an estimate, a cancel path, and `aria-live` announcements.

## Patterns
- **Bottom sheet** (vaul) with snap points and safe-area padding.
- **PWA** — manifest, install prompt, offline shell, `pointer: coarse` guards.
- **Locale switcher** — path-based routing, preserved deep link.
- **Checkout** — PaymentElement + order summary + four states (see also `forms`).
- **OTP email** — React Email template + Resend Server Action.
- **AI-generated image** — generating state per rule 9, not a blank frame; a
  distinct rejected-by-moderation state, never silently swapped for the
  network-error state (the fix is different: rephrase the prompt, not retry).
  `alt` describes the image's actual content once generated, same as any other
  image — never the prompt text, which describes intent, not what rendered. A
  visible regenerate affordance, since an unpredictable result is the point.
- **Extension UI** (VS Code webview / browser popup) — theme from the host's
  CSS variables, never a hardcoded palette; design for a fixed small viewport;
  the CSP forbids remote code, `eval`, and (MV3 default) runtime-injected
  `<style>`, which rules out CSS-in-JS libraries that inject at render time.

## Examples
`examples/good-mobile.tsx` (bottom nav, sheet, pull-to-refresh, swipe) · `examples/good-react-native.tsx` (Expo Router, gesture-handler, Reanimated) · `examples/good-ai-chat.tsx` (streaming, stop, autoscroll).

## Constraints
Shared baseline applies everywhere: TypeScript strict, OKLCH tokens, four states with no fake delays, WCAG 2.2 AA, `prefers-reduced-motion`. Platform-specific: safe-area insets on full-bleed, `SAFE-01`/`TOUCH-01` for mobile surfaces, logical properties for RTL, `Intl.*` for all locale-sensitive formatting.
