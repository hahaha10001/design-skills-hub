/**
 * Generates `home/lib/data.generated.json` — the payload behind the pack's
 * own homepage (`home/`, served at the root of the Pages site).
 *
 * Run:  node tools/pages-data/generate.mjs
 *       node tools/pages-data/generate.mjs --check     # fail if it is stale
 *
 * ── Why the site's data is generated ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The site has two interactive panels that are only worth building if they are
 * true: a router that resolves a sentence to one skill the way the pack does,
 * and a checker that runs a subset of the constraint suite against pasted
 * code. Both need the registry's trigger keywords, each skill's declared core
 * deps, and each skill's measured token budget — three sources that move
 * independently and have each gone stale in this repo before.
 *
 * `scripts/check_figures.py`'s `SCAN` list covers `home/components/*.tsx`,
 * `home/lib/*.ts` and `home/*.json`, so a figure written in the page's prose
 * is held to the filesystem exactly as it was for `.github/pages/*.html`
 * before this file replaced it. That is why the payload below is imported at
 * build time rather than fetched or hand-copied: a React component that reads
 * `data.figures.ciConstraints` cannot itself go stale, because there is no
 * second, hand-typed copy of the number for it to drift from. The file this
 * generator used to write (`.github/pages/data.js`) needed a second check —
 * `checkMarkupFallbacks` — specifically because the static page ALSO carried a
 * bare-numeral `<dd>` fallback for readers with JavaScript off, and that
 * fallback was a hand-typed literal with nothing else forcing it to agree.
 * `home/` has no JS-off fallback to duplicate a number into, so that check has
 * no counterpart here — removing it is a simplification the new architecture
 * earns, not a check dropped for convenience.
 *
 * ── The sources, and what each one is authoritative for ──────────────────────
 *
 *   SKILL.md (root)      the registry: id, path, trigger keywords, the ONE core
 *                        dep the row advertises
 *   catalog/<id>/SKILL.md the frontmatter `core-deps:` — what actually loads,
 *                        which is a superset of the row's single cell
 *   README.md            the three grouped skill tables: what each skill covers
 *                        and a sentence that routes there. Prose belongs in
 *                        prose; copying it here by hand would fork it.
 *   check_figures.py     every count and token figure, including the per-skill
 *                        budget table
 *   install/             one directory per shipped adapter — the source of
 *                        the "14 adapters" figure `metadata.json` states
 *
 * Nothing is counted where it can be derived. The predecessor of this file
 * (`tools/readme-router/generate.mjs`) shipped a banner whose skill count was
 * hand-decremented and whose guard compared it against another hand-maintained
 * number: the banner and its guard agreed with each other and both were wrong.
 * So every cross-source relationship below is asserted as a SET, not a count —
 * the registry's ids against the directories on disk against the README's rows
 * against the budget table's rows. A skill missing from any one of them is a
 * named failure, not a silently shorter list. The adapter label map below
 * follows the same rule: an `install/` directory with no mapped label fails
 * generation rather than falling back to a guessed display name.
