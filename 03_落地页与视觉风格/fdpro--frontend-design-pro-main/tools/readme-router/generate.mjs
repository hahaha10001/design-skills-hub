/**
 * Generates `.github/assets/router.svg` — the routing diagram in README.md.
 *
 * Run:  node tools/readme-router/generate.mjs
 *
 * ── What it shows, and why this and not something prettier ───────────────────
 *
 * The single least-believed claim this project makes is the architecture one:
 * that a pack holding hundreds of thousands of tokens of material costs a few
 * thousand per request, because it is a registry that routes rather than a
 * document that loads. README states it in a table. A table is the wrong shape
 * for it — the whole point is a ratio, and a ratio wants a picture.
 *
 * So: a request arrives, its keywords match, the scan runs the registry, ONE of
 * nineteen skills locks, its declared core files attach, and the cost meter
 * fills — against a depth bar drawn at true scale, where the loaded sliver is
 * about a fifty-sixth of the whole. Nothing here is a metaphor for the product.
 * It is the product's control flow.
 *
 * ── The figures are read, not typed ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every number on this banner comes from `scripts/check_figures.py --truth`,
 * which computes them from the filesystem. Hardcoding them here would put the
 * pack's headline figures on its most prominent surface with a hand-maintained
 * copy behind them, which is the exact defect Gate 11 exists to prevent and has
 * caught three times.
 *
 * Python is required rather than optional, and the generator fails loudly
 * without it. A fallback to committed constants would be a silent path to a
 * stale banner, and "the numbers were right when someone last had python
 * installed" is not a claim this project gets to make.
 *
 * ── Gate 11 cannot protect this file, so `--check` does ──────────────────────
 *
 *   node tools/readme-router/generate.mjs            # write the banner
 *   node tools/readme-router/generate.mjs --check    # fail if it is stale
 *
 * The obvious guard was to add `.github/assets/*.svg` to Gate 11's SCAN. It was
 * tried, and it does not work. The figure patterns match inside SVG exactly as
 * they do in prose — and the gate still passed a banner whose skill count had
 * been deliberately decremented, because every match is dropped by the forbid
 * look-back window, which in SVG is always full of attribute soup rather than
 * sentence. Widening those windows to accommodate markup would weaken them
 * everywhere they currently work. `scripts/check_figures.py` records the finding
 * where the entry would have gone.
 *
 * (Writing that sentence with the wrong count spelled out failed Gate 11 from
 * this very docstring, because every generator under `tools/` is a scanned
 * surface. Which is the gate working, and the fourth time this repo has tripped
 * over a comment that explained a defect by reproducing it. The glob itself
 * cannot be written here either — it ends in the two characters that close a
 * block comment.)
 *
 * `--check` is what replaced it, and it is strictly stronger than the regex
 * would have been: it re-runs the whole generator against the current truth
 * table and byte-compares the result with the committed file. Not "does a
 * pattern find a wrong number" but "is this artifact exactly what the source of
 * truth produces right now". A figure moving anywhere in the pack fails it.
 *
 * ── What a GitHub README can actually render ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Same envelope as the hero banner, for the same reason — camo proxies README
 * images and serves them as image documents. No script, no external stylesheet,
 * no webfont, no second request of any kind. A self-contained SVG with inline
 * CSS @keyframes is what survives, so that is what this emits, on system font
 * stacks.
 *
 * ── Everything degrades to the completed route ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every animated element's RESTING attribute value is its resolved state: the
 * keywords highlighted, one skill lit, the deps attached, the meter full. CSS
 * only animates away from that and back. A renderer that drops the stylesheet
 * therefore shows a finished route — correct, readable, and still making the
 * argument — rather than an empty frame. `prefers-reduced-motion` resolves to
 * the same place; the scan is the only thing lost, and the scan is decoration.
 *
 * ── Why a generator ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nineteen rows, each needing its own @keyframes. An infinitely-repeating CSS
 * animation applies `animation-delay` to the FIRST iteration only, so a stagger
 * built from delays desynchronises from the scan on every loop after the first —
 * the same trap the hero banner documents. Each row's flash is instead written
 * at its own percentage, computed from where the scan actually is when it
 * arrives. That is arithmetic, not authoring.
