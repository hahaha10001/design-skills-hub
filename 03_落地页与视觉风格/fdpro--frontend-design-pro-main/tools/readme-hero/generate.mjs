/**
 * Generates `.github/assets/hero.svg` — the animated banner at the top of README.md.
 *
 * Run:  node tools/readme-hero/generate.mjs
 *
 * ── What the banner shows ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A component on an audit bench. A scan beam sweeps it top to bottom, and as it
 * crosses each element that element resolves from dim to lit and its constraint
 * ticks green — type scale, contrast, focus ring, colour space — ending on a
 * PASS. That is the product, not a metaphor for it: this pack is constraints a
 * machine checks, and the banner is the checking.
 *
 * The previous banner was an isometric field, and it was replaced rather than
 * tuned. Its columns were #1C2739 on a #0A0E17 ground — about 1.3:1 — so the
 * "3D" read as faint texture, the type scrim erased the left 40% of it, and the
 * accent crest was a shimmer at 2% of the frame. It had no focal point and it
 * said nothing about what the pack does. Contrast was the surface defect;
 * having no subject was the real one.
 *
 * ── What a GitHub README can actually render ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * GitHub proxies every README image through camo and renders it as an image
 * document, which rules out most of the ways you would normally animate
 * something:
 *
 *   - no <script>, ever;
 *   - no external stylesheet, and no @import or <link> for a web font;
 *   - no external anything — one request, or it does not render.
 *
 * What DOES survive is a fully self-contained SVG with inline CSS @keyframes,
 * which is why this file emits exactly that. SVG filters are fine — they are
 * computed in-document, not fetched — so the bloom and shadow here are real
 * feGaussianBlur rather than faked with stacked translucent shapes.
 *
 * The same restriction is why the type sits on system font stacks rather than
 * the faces the demo page uses: a webfont cannot be fetched, and embedding one
 * as base64 would add hundreds of kilobytes to a banner.
 *
 * It is also why the banner paints its own dark ground instead of adapting to
 * the reader's theme. GitHub's <picture> + prefers-color-scheme trick works, but
 * it needs two files that must be kept in step by hand — a second thing to go
 * stale, for a banner that reads correctly on both themes as it is.
 *
 * ── Everything degrades to the finished audit ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Fills are presentation ATTRIBUTES and every animated element's *resting*
 * attribute value is its LIT state. The stylesheet only ever animates away from
 * that and back. So if any proxy or renderer drops the CSS, the banner shows a
 * completed audit — every row lit, every check green, no beam — which is a
 * correct still frame rather than a broken one. Had the lit state lived only in
 * CSS, the same event would have rendered a dim grey panel on the project's most
 * prominent surface.
 *
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` resolves to that same finished state, deliberately:
 * the beam is the only thing lost, and the beam is the decoration.
 *
 * ── Why a generator instead of a hand-written SVG ────────────────────────────
 *
 * The per-row reveal timings, the perspective floor and the drift field are all
 * arithmetic. More to the point, an infinitely-repeating CSS animation applies
 * `animation-delay` to the FIRST iteration only — so staggering the rows with
 * delays would desynchronise them from the beam on every loop after the first.
 * Each row instead gets its own @keyframes with the transition at its own
 * percentage, computed from where the beam actually is. That is not something to
 * maintain by hand.
 *
 * ── No figures about this pack appear on the banner ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Deliberate, and the reasoning held up under test. Gate 11 does not read SVG,
 * so any count drawn here would be a number no gate can see, on the most
 * prominent surface the project has. The constraint labels are named, never
 * counted.
 *
 * Adding `.github/assets/*.svg` to Gate 11's SCAN was tried and reverted, and
 * the reason is worth knowing before trying it again: the patterns DO match
 * inside SVG, and the gate still passes a banner corrupted to a wrong number,
 * because each figure's forbid window reads the preceding ~50 characters and in
 * SVG those are always attribute soup. `scripts/check_figures.py` carries the
 * detail at the point where the entry would have gone.
 *
 * `tools/readme-router/generate.mjs` is the banner that does make a
 * quantitative claim. It reads every figure from `check_figures.py --truth` and
 * supports `--check` to re-render and diff, which is byte-exact rather than
 * pattern-based — the guard this file would want if it ever grew a number.
