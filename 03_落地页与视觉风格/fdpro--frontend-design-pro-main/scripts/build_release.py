build_release.py — the ONLY supported way to produce frontend-design-pro-v{VERSION}.skill.

Runs every quality gate in order; if any fails, no archive is built, no version escapes.
A .skill archive produced by this script is, by construction, A+ compliant.

Usage:
  python scripts/build_release.py            # full gated release
  python scripts/build_release.py --dry-run  # run all gates + checks, build nothing
  python scripts/build_release.py --bump-patch  # increment patch in metadata.json + CHANGELOG, then release
                                                # (stops at pre-flight until README's "What's new" names the new version)

Exit 0 only if every gate passed (and, unless --dry-run, an archive was built and smoke-tested).

# QUOTING a bad link is not read as making one. The cost of that rule is a blind
# spot the size of the corpus: the pack cites its own files in backticks far more
# often than in link form, and not one of those pointers was read by anything.
#
# They rot the same way links do. Four dead ones shipped in `motion-budget.md`
# and `react-bits.md` until a human happened to read them, and `payments.md` has

#
# The hard part is not finding them, it is not crying wolf. A citation resolves
# under any of six forms the pack genuinely uses, and only a path-SHAPED string
# is judged at all — a bare `motion.md` is shorthand for "the reference named
# motion", resolved by the reader against the skill's own Reference Index, and
# demanding a directory on it would flag ~250 correct sentences.
#

# ── Stage 4.5 — Release source guard ─────────────────────────────────────────
def release_source_guard() -> bool:
    """The archive must be reproducible from a commit the public can fetch.

    v14.4.2 shipped every demo defect the preceding pull request had already
    fixed. The tag was cut from d48546c, which was never main's head, so the
    archive was a *faithful* product of stale source — internally consistent,
    two commits behind, and green through every gate including Stage 6. Stage 6
    cannot catch this by construction: it verifies the archive against itself,
    and the archive was not the thing that was wrong.

    The fetch is the point. A stale `origin/main` ref passes this check
    trivially while proving nothing — during the audit that produced this
    function, the local ref read dc55237 while the real head was 57e9e5f, which
    is exactly the state in which the bad release was cut.

    It resolves main through `git fetch origin main` + FETCH_HEAD rather than the
    `origin/main` remote-tracking ref, because the ref is not always there. The
    release workflow is the most important place this runs — it is the last
    checkpoint before a public publish — and `actions/checkout` lands a shallow,
    detached checkout of the tag with a refspec narrowed to that one ref, so
    `git rev-parse origin/main` returns nothing. Reading the ref would have
    failed every tagged release closed.

    Only a real release build runs this. `--dry-run` is the CI contract and runs
    on every branch and pull request, where being behind main is normal and
    correct.

## Gate Results

| Gate | Result | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
{table}

Plus pre-flight, frontmatter, path integrity, and per-skill budget gates — all blocking.

## Known gaps

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#known-gaps). Summary: the suite runs against
`test/stubs/`, not the examples' ~25 real peer libraries, so it proves the components
mount, expose the roles they claim and survive axe — not that they work against the
real `three` or `react-hook-form`; and reference depth is unevenly distributed across
skills.

## Install

```bash
unzip frontend-design-pro-v{version}.skill -d ~/.claude/skills/
```

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) and [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).

---

All gates passed. No manual changes were made after gate passage — the archive is a
deterministic product of a clean `origin/main` checkout (Stage 4.5 refuses to build from
anything else), re-verified against its own unzipped copy for both compilation and
content (Stage 6).
