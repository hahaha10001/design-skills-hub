Frontend Design Pro — Security scan

The gap this closes
--------------------
`docs/AUDIT.md` (2026-08-10) found a real stored-XSS bug in shipped reference
prose — unescaped `<` in `JSON.stringify`'d JSON-LD, `catalog/platform/references/seo.md`
— by manual, one-time LLM audit. It was fixed as a prose edit. No rule was ever
added to catch that class of bug again, and no `SEC-*` category exists anywhere
in `scripts/test_constraints.py` or `scripts/parser_constraints.js`.

This is that missing check, shipped deliberately OUTSIDE `CONSTRAINTS` and the
`ci_constraints: 60` figure the release gates track: adding entries there means
recomputing that count across ~18 documents that cite it (README, ARCHITECTURE,
CHANGELOG, every per-agent setup doc, ...), which is disproportionate to what
four narrow, high-confidence patterns are worth on their own. It runs as its
own check instead — same shape as `tools/screenshots/visual-regression.mjs`:
real, gated, verifiable, and honest about not being one of the numbered 60.

What it checks, and what it deliberately does not
---------------------------------------------------
Three literal, low-ambiguity patterns:

  SEC-02  a `javascript:` URL scheme in a string literal
  SEC-03  postMessage(..., "*") — wildcard target origin
  SEC-04  raw `.innerHTML =` assignment (vanilla DOM, not JSX)

A fourth was attempted and dropped: `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without a
nearby `DOMPurify.sanitize`/`sanitizeHtml` call. Running it against this
repo's own corpus produced 6 findings, and every one was a false positive —
`home/app/page.tsx` injects build-time-generated CSS text into a `<style>`
tag (no sanitizer call needed; nothing user-controlled ever reaches it), and
`catalog/ai-ui-generation/examples/good-registry-renderer.tsx` only mentions
the API name inside a comment *warning* about it, which a naive substring
match cannot distinguish from a real JSX attribute. The AUDIT.md bug this
was meant to generalize from was fixed by escaping `<` before interpolating
into a JSON-LD `<script>` tag — a mitigation this pattern would never
recognize either, since it only ever looks for a sanitizer-library call.
Whether a `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` value is trusted, static, and
build-time-generated (safe) or user-controlled (not) is exactly the kind of
judgment a static regex cannot make — the same class of limitation that
kept 4 WCAG 2.2 SCs out of `test_constraints.py` this pass (see
docs/CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md, docs/RESEARCH.md). Left as a human-review item
rather than shipped as a rule that would be noisy from day one.

Anti-example files (`bad-*.tsx`) and fenced code blocks that teach the
anti-pattern (preceded by a heading/line containing "bad", "don't", or
"insecure") are skipped — flagging them would invert the lesson, the same
reasoning `check_references.py` (Gate 10) already applies.

Usage:
  python scripts/check_security.py            # catalog/ + core/ + demo/ + home/
  python scripts/check_security.py --json
  python scripts/check_security.py <path>      # one file or directory
