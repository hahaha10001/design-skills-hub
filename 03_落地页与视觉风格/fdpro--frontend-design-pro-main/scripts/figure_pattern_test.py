"""Proof that Gate 11's figure patterns read the prose forms people write.

Gate 11 recomputes every published figure from the filesystem, but it can only
correct a claim it recognises as one. Three times now a figure has gone stale in
a form no pattern matched, and the gate reported the file clean:

  * `35 regex` / `constraints` split over a hard wrap — a public triage document
    sat seven wrong for as long as the gate had existed.
  * `SKILL.md is 2,018 tokens` — docs prose backticks a filename and launch
    prose does not, so all three tracked launch documents shipped the superseded
    router size while the gate called them clean.
  * `5,665 to 7,266 tokens`, and the same band split across two sentences as
    "the heaviest … the lightest …" — neither is a dashed pair, so neither was
    a range as far as the gate was concerned.

Each of those was a *detection* failure, not a data failure, and none of them
was visible in a green run. This file is what makes them visible: fixed prose
fixtures judged against a synthetic truth table, asserting in both directions.

The negative cases matter as much as the positive ones. A pattern widened until
it matches everything is not a stricter gate, it is a broken one — the anchor
here once reached out of `catalog/{id}/SKILL.md` and read the per-skill router
range as the registry size, which would have failed two correct tables.

Truth is synthetic and far apart on purpose. A test pinned to today's real
figures would fail on every release that grows the pack, and would be deleted
the first time it did.
