"""
Gold Example TypeScript Compile Check

Runs `tsc --noEmit` (strict) against all examples/*.tsx.
Compilation errors are BLOCKERS; the regex constraint suite covers style.

Usage:
  python scripts/typecheck_golds.py [--skill-root PATH]

Requires: npm install typescript @types/react @types/react-dom
(anywhere on the resolution path, or globally via npx).

Exit codes: 0 = clean · 1 = tsc errors · 2 = tsc unavailable (skipped)
