Frontend Design Pro — Figure Gate (Gate 11)

The blind spot this closes
--------------------------
`CLAUDE.md` names it in its own words:

    No gate validates prose. Skill/reference/example counts and token figures
    are hardcoded across ~30 documents and go stale silently — this is the
    single most repeated defect in this repo's history.

Every other gate reads code. The defect that keeps shipping is arithmetic in
markdown, and until this gate existed the only defence was remembering to sweep
~30 files by hand after every change that moved a count. That defence failed
often enough to be the stated reason for several releases.

What it costs to leave unguarded is not cosmetic. On the run that produced this
gate, the per-request token band was wrong in **17 live files**, two of which
(`README.md`, `AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`) ship inside the archive — so the file
that tells an agent its own token budget shipped the wrong number. A second,
rounder band (`5,000–6,300`) was circulating in three more places, already
disagreeing with the first before either went stale. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
printed a nineteen-row per-skill budget table in which every row was wrong, under
a heading announcing "Nine named gates" above a table with ten rows.

Design
------
**Truth is computed from the filesystem, never read from `metadata.json`.**
`metadata.json` is itself a claim, and check 3 below is what audits it. A gate
that trusted it would agree with the drift instead of finding it.

**Token figures are LF-normalised.** `.gitattributes` normalises the repo to LF,
so the canonical figure — the one CI measures and the one a reader who downloads
the archive can reproduce — is the LF byte count. `build_release.py:tokens()`
uses the identical LF-normalising body, so Gate 8a and this gate report the same
numbers on Windows and on ubuntu-latest even when a file has been edited to CRLF
and not yet committed — which a gate whose whole job is arithmetic has to do.

Four checks
-----------
1. **Anchored figures.** Each `Figure` is a regex whose captures must equal a
   computed value. The pattern matches the *shape and context* of a figure, not
   a list of known-stale literals — so it catches the next drift, not only this
   one. A figure nobody has written yet is caught the first time someone writes
   it wrong.

2. **Arithmetic consistency.** Finds `A → B … C tokens` triples and asserts
   `B - A == C`. This is the check that catches a partial sweep: a blanket
   substitution that updates an endpoint and leaves the delta behind produces a
   sentence that is individually plausible and collectively impossible.
   `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` claimed two skills grew the registry "from 1,895 to
   2,018 tokens — 103 tokens for both". That subtracts to 123.

3. **`metadata.json` vs the filesystem.** Every `stats` key that can be derived
   is derived and compared.

4. **`metadata.json` changelog vs `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.** These two records of
   the same history drifted apart across two concurrent-session merges — the
   dict silently lost its 14.7.1 and 14.7.2 entries while the markdown kept
   both — and passed a green chain twice, because nothing compared them.

Scope, and why it is a list rather than everything
--------------------------------------------------
`SCAN` is the set of surfaces that make claims *about the pack*. Reference files
are excluded by default: `chart-types.md` saying an axis runs `1,000 – 10,000` is
content, not a claim, and a gate that flagged it would be noise. The one
exception is `catalog/agent-ops/references/token-optimization.md`, which quotes
the pack's own budget and is named in `CLAUDE.md`'s sweep list for that reason,
along with `context-engineering.md`, which opens on the same claim.

Historical records are exempt wholesale. `docs/CHANGELOG.md` and
`docs/RELEASE_NOTES-*` were accurate when cut, and `CLAUDE.md` forbids rewriting
them — a gate that demanded they match today's figures would be demanding the
record be falsified.

Release notes inside a live document have the same need in miniature: naming the
figure that was wrong is the point of a correction. That is handled by a marked
region rather than a file-wide exemption, so the suppression stays visible in the
diff and cannot quietly cover the rest of the file — see `_historical_lines`. A
marker without a stated reason, or without a close, is itself a finding.

Usage:
  python scripts/check_figures.py           # all four checks
  python scripts/check_figures.py --truth   # print the computed truth table
  python scripts/check_figures.py --json    # machine-readable findings
