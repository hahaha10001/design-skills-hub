Frontend Design Pro — Reference Constraint Gate (Gate 10)

The blind spot this closes
--------------------------
`test_constraints.py` globs `*.jsx *.tsx *.html *.js *.ts`. Markdown is not in
that list, so until this gate existed the reference files — the overwhelming
majority of the pack by volume, and the part an agent actually loads for depth —
were read by no gate at all. The constraints ran over the example files, which
are a low single-digit percentage of the corpus.

(Counts are deliberately not stated here. This docstring is not one of Gate 11's
claim surfaces, so a figure written into it goes stale silently — which is what
happened to the two that used to be in this paragraph.)

That is backwards. An example is a demonstration; a reference is an instruction.
When `glassmorphism.md` prescribed `min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br
from-violet-500 via-purple-500 to-pink-500` under a heading reading "Must have",
an agent held that text and SKILL.md's wall banning both in the same context
window, and had to pick a side. This gate makes the corpus agree with the wall.

What it checks, and what it deliberately does not
-------------------------------------------------
Constraints are imported from `test_constraints.py` — one definition, no drift.
Only the BAN-shaped ones are applied (see FRAGMENT_SAFE): a rule like "has a
default export" or "declares a font" is a property of a whole file, and a 9-line
snippet that omits it is correct, not defective. Running presence checks against
fragments would produce noise, and a noisy gate gets muted.

Anti-example blocks are skipped. A reference that shows `React.FC` under
`// Bad —` is teaching the rule, not breaking it, and flagging it would invert
the lesson. A block carrying both a bad and a good half is skipped whole: that
loses a little coverage and costs no false positives, which is the right trade
for a gate meant to stay trusted.

Usage:
  python scripts/check_references.py            # every reference + skill + core file
  python scripts/check_references.py --json     # machine-readable
  python scripts/check_references.py <file.md>  # one file
