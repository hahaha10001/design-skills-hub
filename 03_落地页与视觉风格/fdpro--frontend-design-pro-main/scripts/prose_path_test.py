"""Proof that Stage 3's prose-path check resolves the forms people write.

`markdown_links()` strips inline code spans so that prose *quoting* a bad link
is not read as making one. The cost of that rule was a blind spot the size of
the corpus: this pack cites its own files in backticks far more often than in
link form, and until `prose_paths()` existed not one of those pointers was read
by anything. Fourteen were dead when the check was written — three in
`payments.md` alone, pointing at another skill's directory since the day it was
authored, and four more found by hand in `motion-budget.md` and `react-bits.md`.

The hard half is not detection, it is not crying wolf. A citation resolves under
six different forms the pack genuinely uses, and a check that understood only
one of them would have shouted about ~250 correct sentences on its first run —
which is how a gate gets muted and then deleted.

So the negatives here carry as much weight as the positives:

  * a bare `motion.md` is shorthand for "the reference named motion", resolved
    by the reader against the skill's own Reference Index. It is not a path and
    must never be judged as one.
  * `frontend-design-pro/SKILL.md` is where the pack lives after the archive is
    unzipped. Every install document says it, and none of them is wrong.
  * `_meta/CHANGELOG.md` is real — in the archive. `build_release.py` relocates
    `docs/CHANGELOG.md` there, so the citation is correct and the repo path
    simply is not the shipped one.
  * `catalog/{id}/SKILL.md` and `references/foo.md` are schema slots in prose
    about the layout. They name files that are not supposed to exist.

Fixtures are synthetic paths against a synthetic tree, not today's real files:
a test pinned to the live corpus would fail on the first release that renames a
reference, and would be deleted the first time it did.
