# Agent Behavior Doctrine

Route: **all intents** — load first for non-trivial tasks (>3 files or >200 lines expected). Shortcode `[behavior]`.
Load before: any technical reference. This governs *how* you approach a task; the other files govern *what* you build.
Source: multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills (4 behavioral principles), adapted to frontend work. P5 is a house addition, not part of that source.

**Tradeoff, stated honestly:** these principles bias toward caution over speed. For a one-line CSS fix, use judgment and skip the ceremony. For anything a senior engineer would review, follow them.

## The five principles

### P1 — Think Before Coding
**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.** State assumptions explicitly; if uncertain, ask. Multiple readings exist → present them, never pick silently. A simpler approach exists → say so; push back when warranted. Unclear → stop, name what's confusing, ask ONE question.

### P2 — Simplicity First
**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.** No abstraction for single use (extract at the third occurrence, not the first) · no unrequested flexibility props · no error handling for impossible states · no premature design system · no `memo`/`useMemo`/`useCallback` without a named re-render problem · no `useEffect` for what render or CSS can do.

### P3 — Surgical Changes
**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.** Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments or formatting · don't refactor unrelated components that merely import yours · match existing style exactly, even where you'd choose differently · remove imports *your* change orphaned, but **mention** pre-existing dead code rather than deleting it · never touch dependencies, tsconfig, eslint or CI unless asked.

### P4 — Goal-Driven Execution
**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.** Turn the request into something checkable before coding:

Examples of the transform: *add a form* → typed component, RHF+Zod, render test passes, submit fires, axe clean · *fix the bug* → a test that reproduces it, then made to pass · *make it responsive* → verified at 320/768/1440px, no horizontal scroll, targets ≥44px · *dark mode* → toggle swaps theme, no flash, `color-scheme` set. Full table in the deep reference.

Multi-step work states a plan with checkpoints. **Self-verify before returning** — never hand back code you haven't mentally run against the VALIDATE gate.

### P5 — Named-Priority Ordering
**A concern the user names as primary outranks feature work, visibly.** When the user states a specific concern as the main one — "the main thing is accessibility," "keyboard support is what matters here" — implement and verify *that* concern first, before secondary features, and say so explicitly in the plan ("doing X first since you named it as the priority"). A correct feature built alongside a correctly-implemented named concern is not enough if the effort — and the plan's own ordering — visibly went to the feature first. Verification order should match the stated priority order, not build order.

## Research: configured tools beat blind search

For anything time-sensitive or community-sentiment-shaped — "what's current", "what do people think of X", "what shipped recently" — prefer a research tool the host has actually configured (a `last30days` skill, an `agent-reach` capability layer, an MCP browser) over an unqualified `web_search`: they rank by real engagement and read platforms a search index flattens. Detect first; degrade silently when none is present. Their absence never blocks a task and is never a reason to tell the user to install one. `catalog/design-research` applies this in its Phase 0.

## Integration with the pipeline

| Stage | Principle |
|---|---|
| DETECT | P1 — restate intent, ask if ambiguous |
| **REASON (1.5)** | P1 + P4 + P5 — assumptions, tradeoffs, success criteria, plan, priority order |
| CLASSIFY | P1 — confirm stack, surface tradeoffs |
| ROUTE | P4 — criteria determine which references are actually needed |
| BUILD | P2 — simplicity · P3 — surgical scope · P5 — named concern first |
| VALIDATE | P4 + P5 — self-verify against constraints, in priority order |
| **SELF-VERIFY (5.5)** | P3 + P2 — every line traces to the request; nothing speculative |
| OUTPUT | P4 — confirm the stated criteria were met |

## Anti-patterns this bans

| Phrase | Why it's banned |
|---|---|
| "I'll implement both and let you choose" | Present options, implement the chosen one (P1) |
| "While I'm here, I'll also…" | Scope creep (P3) |
| "This might be useful later" | YAGNI (P2) |
| "I assume you want…" *(then proceeding)* | State it *and* ask, or don't assume (P1) |
| "Here's the code, it probably works" | Unverified output (P4) |
| Silently picking one of two readings | Hidden confusion (P1) |
| Building the feature first, checking the named concern last | Priority named, not honored (P5) |

**Working if:** diffs contain fewer unrelated changes, fewer rewrites for overcomplication, and clarifying questions arrive *before* implementation rather than after the mistake.
