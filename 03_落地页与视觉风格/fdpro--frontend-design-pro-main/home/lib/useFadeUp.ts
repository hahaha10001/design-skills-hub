/**
 * The only motion on this page: one fade-up as a section enters the viewport.
 *
 * ── Why an IntersectionObserver and not a scroll handler ─────────────────────
 *
 * A scroll listener runs on the main thread on every frame of every scroll, for
 * every section that registered one, and computes layout to answer a question
 * the browser already knows the answer to. IntersectionObserver answers it off
 * the main thread and fires once.
 *
 * ── Reduced motion is checked BEFORE observing, not after ────────────────────
 *
 * When the preference is set, this reveals immediately and never observes
 * anything. The naive shape — observe, then skip the transition — still starts
 * the element at `opacity: 0`, so a reader who has asked for less motion gets a
 * page whose content is invisible until they scroll past it. That is strictly
 * worse for them than for everybody else, which is the opposite of the point.
 *
 * `lib/tokens.ts` also carries a `prefers-reduced-motion` rule forcing
 * `[data-fade]` visible. That is not redundant: this hook reads the preference
 * once at mount, and a reader who turns it on afterwards would otherwise be
 * left with sections stranded at zero opacity and no way to reveal them.
 *
 * ── Reveal once ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The observer disconnects after the first intersection. Re-hiding a section
 * when it leaves the viewport means content that vanishes on scroll-up, which
 * reads as a rendering bug rather than as an effect.
