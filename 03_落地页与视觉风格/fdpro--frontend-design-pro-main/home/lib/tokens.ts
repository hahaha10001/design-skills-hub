/*
 * World system — a per-section "surface texture", layered on top of a

 * part of every section that already clears axe contrast (solid colour
 * behind text) never moves, only a low-opacity image sits on top of it.
 * \`[data-world]\` is set on \`<html>\` by the blocking script in
 * \`app/layout.tsx\` (or by \`WorldProvider\`'s reroll); every section adds
 * one \`data-section-surface\` attribute alongside its existing className —
 * see \`home/lib/worlds.ts\` for the catalog and the verification-scope note.
 *
 * \`signature\` — the default and the deterministic \`?world=signature\` world
 * every automated check and screenshot recapture uses — carries a static
 * grain texture of its own (below). It is the quietest of the four: a
 * desaturated \`feTurbulence\` at 3.5% alpha, no colour, no motion. Paired
 * with the 1px section seams (also below) and the deeper \`bg-surface\` cream
 * (\`../tokens.css\`), it gives the ~7,000px below-hero region a felt surface
 * and legible section boundaries without a gradient, a shadow, or a second
 * hue. Re-verified against \`pages:verify\`'s axe pass.
 *
 * All four textures are intentionally low-opacity (~3.5-6%): the goal is a
 * felt texture, not a colour shift large enough to move an already-computed
 * contrast ratio. \`mesh\`'s three radial gradients read the CURRENT
 * \`--color-accent\` via \`color-mix()\` rather than a hardcoded colour, so it
 * always matches whichever world set that variable — no hex, no rgba(),
 * OKLCH throughout.
