/**
 * Hero's `mesh` world ground — layered `color-mix(in oklch, …)` radial
 * gradients, no canvas at all, so unlike the hero's object (gated behind a
 * 640px `matchMedia`, which the WebGL hero object used to carry) this
 * renders at every viewport
 * width. It is the ground the object stands on, not a hero of its own — that
 * split is what lets all four worlds share one object. Reads the
 * CURRENT `--color-accent` live, so it always matches whichever world set
 * that variable; no hardcoded hex or rgba anywhere in this file. Drift is a
 * single `background-position` keyframe (`mesh-drift`, in `lib/tokens.ts`).
 * The page's global reduced-motion rule already clamps it to one 1ms frame;
 * `motion-reduce:` below states the same intent locally too, because a global
 * rule is easy to narrow by accident and a local one is not.
 *
 * This used to cite the hero's scroll-indicator icon as the matching example
 * of that belt-and-braces pairing. There is no such icon: it went with the
 * hero rebuild, and the hero deliberately has no scroll cue at all now — its
 * height is 86dvh so the next section's seam sits above the fold, which is the
 * cue an arrow was compensating for. A comment that sends a reader to a
 * deleted element to learn a convention is worse than no comment, and this one
 * survived two hero rewrites by being about something else.
