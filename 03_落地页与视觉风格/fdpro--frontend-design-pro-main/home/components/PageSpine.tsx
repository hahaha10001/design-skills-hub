/**
 * The route the page itself takes, drawn in the outer margin exactly as far as
 * the reader has scrolled.
 *
 * **The waypoints are measured, not authored.** There are no hand-placed
 * positions in this file. On mount the component reads the real bounding box
 * of every `:scope > section` inside `<main>` and puts a waypoint at each
 * centre, so the marks are the page's own stages and the gaps between them are
 * the page's own rhythm — the hero's long opener, the short install close. Add
 * a section and it gets a waypoint; change a section's height and one moves.
 *
 * **It is a straight rail, and that is a correction rather than a compromise.**
 * The first version of this drew an SVG curve weaving between two rails. Two
 * separate measurements killed it. Rendered, 80px of horizontal excursion
 * spread over an 8,500px page reads as a straight line — no amplitude that
 * fits the free margin changes that. Profiled, the SVG cost one forced layout
 * per scroll frame: writing `stroke-dashoffset` on a path and `transform` on a
 * `<g>` both dirty SVG layout in Blink, and on the built page at 4x CPU
 * throttle that was **251 layouts on an upward scroll against 3 with the spine
 * off the page**. It was spending a layout per frame to draw a curve nobody
 * could see, and it was felt as stutter.
 *
 * So the per-frame update is now transform-only on plain HTML elements, which
 * the compositor handles without layout, style recalc or paint: one
 * `scaleY` for the drawn length, one `translate3d` for the head. Waypoint
 * opacities are written only when the set of reached waypoints actually
 * changes, rather than re-asserted seven at a time every frame.
 *
 * **`Skiper19`'s mechanic, this page's runtime.** The technique — one
 * continuous line whose drawn length tracks scroll progress — was prompted by
 * Skiper UI's `Skiper19` (`@gurvinder-singh02`, skiper-ui.com), which reaches
 * it through Framer Motion's `useScroll` + `pathLength`. `home/` already runs
 * GSAP and ScrollTrigger for every other scroll-linked effect here, so adding
 * a second animation runtime would be pure bundle cost. Nothing else from that
 * component travelled — not its palette (an acid green on navy, one of the
 * three AI-design clusters this pack's own wall names), not its display face,
 * not its 350vh scroll region, and not its path data.
 *
 * **Not a hairline column.** `lib/tokens.ts` says the section seams are
 * horizontal only, because a vertical rule between sections would read as the
 * anti-slop wall's "broadsheet hairline columns". That prohibition is about a
 * repeating grid of straight rules used as structure, and it still stands.
 * This is one line in the outer margin that touches no content, carries the
 * reader's position, and is absent until scrolled.
 *
 * **Reduced motion gets the finished route.** Not hidden and not faded to: the
 * route is information about the page's shape, so it renders complete and
 * static, and the head is removed — a head on a motionless route would mark a
 * reading position that isn't moving.
 *
 * **It does render on a phone**, which it did not at first. The objection was
 * that the free margin below `sm` is `sectionShell`'s 20px of padding and a
 * rail parked against the text the way it is at 1280 would foul the copy. That
 * is an argument against one placement rule, not against the rail — so the
 * geometry is now driven from the ink outward (`CLEARANCE`), and a 12px band
 * flush to the window clears the first character by 8px. A reader scrolling
 * thirteen screens on a phone is the one who most needs to know how far
 * through they are.
