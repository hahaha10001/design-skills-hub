/**
 * The reference corpus, drawn to scale, closed into a ring.
 *
 * **What replaced what, and why this is the fourth hero visual.** The first
 * sampled the headline into a particle field; the second extruded the 119
 * references as strata of a WebGL slab; the third laid the same 119 marks out
 * as a flowing block of set type. The third was right about the medium and
 * wrong about two things a screenshot showed immediately.
 *
 * The first is that it did not render at all. `Hero.tsx` ran
 * `gsap.from(marks, { opacity: 0, scaleX: 0, delay: 0.3 })` over all 119
 * `<rect>`s while this component set each mark's `opacity` as an SVG
 * presentation attribute and transitioned it in CSS. Two systems owned one
 * property. Measured against the shipped production build: **0 of 119 marks
 * were visible at 500ms, and still 0 at 8s** — the tween wrote its `from`
 * state and never advanced, so every reader with motion enabled met an empty
 * half-hero and a caption describing marks that were not there. Under
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` the effect returned early, never touched the marks,
 * and the hero looked correct — which is exactly why it passed every check.
 *
 * The rule this component is built to keep: **one owner per property.** No
 * animation library touches a mark. Every value a mark renders with comes from
 * React state, and the only motion is a CSS transition on a property nothing
 * else writes. There is no `useRef` into this subtree and no `gsap.context`
 * around it.
 *
 * The second thing was composition. Set flush left as a block, the corpus sat
 * in the right half of a two-column hero as an unshaped grey rectangle — an
 * arbitrary silhouette that had to be captioned to be understood.
 *
 * **A ring is not decoration here; it is the claim's own shape.** What the
 * sentence beside it says is a *ratio*: one skill loads, the rest stay on
 * disk. A ratio is a part against a whole, and a closed loop is the one figure
 * that shows a whole without needing a scale printed under it — you can see
 * that the lit tick is one of many because the many close back around to it.
 * A flush-left block has a beginning and an end and shows neither.
 *
 * Same data, same rules as the block it replaces. One tick per real file under
 * a skill's `references/` directory; **tick length proportional to that file's
 * real token count**, linear and unsmoothed, so the handful of long files read as
 * long and the median reads as short — which is the truth about this corpus,
 * and prettier curves would be a lie about it. A wider angular gap at each of
 * the 19 skill boundaries, so the groups read as groups. Nothing sampled,
 * rounded or invented: `tokens` is the repo's canonical measure and the
 * generator asserts both the count and the sum against `check_figures.py
 * --truth` before writing the JSON, so this drawing cannot disagree with the
 * figures in the sentence next to it.
 *
 * **The loop is traversed once, not spun forever.** A read head — a short
 * accent arc — travels the full circle on load and comes to rest on the lit
 * tick, which is what a request actually does to this corpus. It is one CSS
 * transition on one `stroke-dashoffset`, so when it finishes the page
 * schedules no further work. That restraint is not taste, it is this repo's
 * own measurement: a previous hero carried a slow perpetual rotation and cost
 * a 29.9ms median frame against a 16.7ms baseline for a drift no reader would
 * notice. Nothing here animates at rest.
 *
 * **And then the reader drives it.** Past the resting tick the head is bound
 * to scroll: as the hero leaves the viewport it completes exactly one more
 * turn, arriving back where it started as the section closes. The technique
 * came from Skiper UI's `Skiper19` — a stroke whose `pathLength` follows
 * scroll progress — and it needed almost nothing to adopt, because this ring
 * was already built on that primitive: `pathLength={1}`, a normalised dash,
 * one offset. What the original supplies as a decorative squiggle (2,319 units
 * of hand-copied path data meaning nothing) is here the read head crossing 119
 * real files.
 *
 * That is also the whole reason it is scroll-bound rather than looping. At
 * rest the head sits on one tick and the caption prices it: a request loaded
 * this. Scrolling continues the traversal past it, through the files the
 * request did *not* load, and the ring closes as the argument moves on. A
 * perpetual spin would say the opposite — that the corpus is being read
 * continuously, which is the claim this page exists to deny.
 *
 * The original arrives with `framer-motion`, a `scrollYProgress: any`, four
 * hardcoded hex colours and no reduced-motion path — measured here as
 * `MOTION-01`, `TS-01-AST` and `COL-04`. None of that was needed to take the
 * idea: the driver below is 20 lines, adds no dependency, and is off entirely
 * under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
 *
 * Pointing at any tick moves the read head to it and prices it. That is the
 * architecture demonstrated rather than asserted: every one of these is a file
 * the agent did *not* load, and the reader can cost each one by touching it.
 *
 * **It is one image to a screen reader, not 119 tab stops.** A hero that puts
 * 119 focusable nodes ahead of the primary action is hostile whatever its
 * intentions, so the figure carries a text alternative stating the real
 * numbers and the pointer behaviour is an enhancement. The same facts are in
 * the paragraph beside it and in `#how-it-works` below.
