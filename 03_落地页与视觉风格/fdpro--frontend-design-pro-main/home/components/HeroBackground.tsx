/**
 * The hero's ground — one light, and the world's texture over it.
 *
 * **What this no longer does.** The version this replaces also painted a
 * full-bleed `linear-gradient` accent wash and, over it, a large radial scrim
 * of solid `bg-page`. The scrim existed because the animated scene sat
 * directly behind the headline and `pages:verify`'s axe pass kept catching
 * intermittent `color-contrast` failures — intermittent because they depended
 * on whatever colour the shader happened to be under the text that frame. It
 * worked, and it became the largest shape in the composition: a bug fix that
 * read as the design.
 *
 * Both are gone rather than restyled. The object now lives in its own grid
 * track beside the copy (`HeroCorpusRing`, placed by `Hero.tsx`) instead of
 * behind it, so there is nothing animated under the text to protect it from.
 * That also removes the last gradient this component owned — `home/DESIGN.md`
 * §2's sanction is narrower after this change, not wider.
 *
 * `mounted` holds the world switch back until after hydration: `useWorld()`
 * is already correct on the first CLIENT render, because the blocking script
 * in `app/layout.tsx` sets `data-world` on `<html>` before hydration and
 * `WorldProvider` reads it straight from the DOM — but the SERVER render has
 * no `document` and always falls back to `DEFAULT_WORLD_ID`. Switching on
 * `world.id` directly would make the hydration pass disagree with the
 * server-rendered HTML whenever the resolved world isn't `signature`.
 *
 * `signature` renders no *texture* here: its grain is a below-hero surface
 * treatment (`lib/tokens.ts`'s `--world-texture` channel). What it does render
 * is `HeroBeams`, which every world renders — the beams are the hero's own
 * light rather than a property of a world, which is why they sit outside the
 * switch. That keeps the stated model intact: a world is a ground texture and
 * a hue, not a different hero.
 *
 * The one gradient this component owns is therefore back, deliberately and
 * differently: masked off the type entirely and absent below `lg:`, rather
 * than full-bleed behind the headline with a scrim over it. `home/DESIGN.md`
 * §2 records the sanction and why this shape is not the shape that failed.
