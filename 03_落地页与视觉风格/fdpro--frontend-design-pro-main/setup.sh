# frontend-design-pro — native adapter installer.
#
# Copies one agent's native rules/instructions file into YOUR project, so the
# agent routes through the registry without you hand-writing the file.
#
# It does NOT install the pack itself. Unzip the .skill archive first — the
# adapters reference `frontend-design-pro/SKILL.md`, so the pack has to be
# present at that path relative to the project root:
#
#   unzip frontend-design-pro-v*.skill -d ./
#
# Usage:
#   bash setup.sh                        auto-detect the agent from the target dir
#   bash setup.sh cursor                 install one adapter
#   bash setup.sh cursor --target ../app install into a directory other than $PWD
#   bash setup.sh --list                 every adapter and how it installs
#   bash setup.sh cursor --dry-run       print what would be written, write nothing
#   bash setup.sh cursor --force         overwrite files that already exist
#
# Nothing is overwritten without --force, because these are filenames other
# tools legitimately own: a project may already have a .cursor/rules/ entry or
# a CONVENTIONS.md, and silently replacing one to save a prompt is not a trade
# an installer gets to make.

# An adapter is auto-installable when its payload is a file that can safely be

# adding a directory is the whole of adding an adapter.
