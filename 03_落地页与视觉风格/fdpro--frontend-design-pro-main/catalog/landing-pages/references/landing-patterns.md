## Pattern 1 — Hero + Features + CTA

**Keywords**: hero, cta, saas, b2b, classic

**Section order**:
```
Hero (full-viewport VP) → Value prop strip → Features (3–5 cards) → Social proof → CTA → Footer
```

**CTA placement**: Hero sticky + bottom section

**Color strategy**: Brand primary, `#FAFAFA` card backgrounds, contrasting accent for CTA button (7:1 contrast ratio minimum)

**Effects**: Parallax on hero background, hover-lift on feature cards (`translateY(-4px)`), glow on CTA button

**Conversion tips**:
- 7:1 contrast ratio on CTA — non-negotiable
- Sticky navbar CTA (smaller variant, same color)
- Feature cards: icon + headline + 1-sentence description — no paragraphs
- Social proof positioned immediately before nearest CTA

---

## Pattern 2 — Hero + Testimonials + CTA

**Keywords**: testimonials, social-proof, reviews, trust

**Section order**:
```
Hero → Problem statement → Solution overview → Testimonials (3–5) → CTA → Footer
```

**CTA placement**: Hero sticky + post-testimonials

**Color strategy**: Brand color, `#F5F5F5` background, `#666` for quote text

**Effects**: Carousel slides with auto-advance (pause on hover), fade-in animations on scroll

**Conversion tips**:
- 3–5 testimonials minimum; include photo + name + role + company
- Position testimonials BEFORE the CTA — never after
- Use real photos, not avatars; real names, not initials

---

## Pattern 3 — Product Demo + Features

**Keywords**: demo, interactive, showcase, video, mockup

**Section order**:
```
Hero → Video/mockup center → Features list → Comparison → CTA
```

**CTA placement**: Inline with video/mockup center + CTA right/below

**Color strategy**: Brand overlay on video, `#0080FF` icon accents

**Effects**: Video pulse animation on play button, scroll-triggered feature reveals

**Conversion tips**:
- Interactive mockup preferred over static screenshot
- Auto-play video muted; show captions toggle
- Feature list should annotate the demo, not repeat the hero copy

---

## Pattern 4 — Minimal Single Column

**Keywords**: minimal, simple, direct, clean, personal

**Section order**:
```
Hero → Description → Benefits (3 max) → CTA → Footer
```

**CTA placement**: Centered, large primary button

**Color strategy**: Brand accent + `#FFFFFF` background + single accent color only

**Effects**: Subtle hover scale on CTA (`scale(1.02)`), no scroll animations

**Conversion tips**:
- Large typography (clamp `2.5rem`–`5rem`) — whitespace is the design
- Mobile-first; test at 390px first
- Max 3 benefits; cut everything else
- One CTA. One. Not two.

---

## Pattern 5 — Funnel (3-Step)

**Keywords**: funnel, conversion, wizard, steps, progressive

**Section order**:
```
Hero → Step 1 (problem) → Step 2 (solution) → Step 3 (action) → Main CTA
```

**CTA placement**: Mini-CTA at each step transition + primary CTA at end

**Color strategy**: Red → Orange → Green progression matching urgency-to-resolution

**Effects**: Progress bar fill animation between steps, step entrance animations

**Conversion tips**:
- Progressive disclosure; never show all content at once
- Each step must answer one question and move forward
- Progress bar keeps users committed (completion psychology)

---

## Pattern 6 — Comparison Table + CTA

**Keywords**: comparison, table, versus, competitor, side-by-side

**Section order**:
```
Hero → Problem framing → Comparison table (you vs. competitors) → Pricing → CTA
```

**CTA placement**: In your highlighted table column + below table

**Color strategy**: Alternating table rows, `#FFFACD` highlight on your column, competitors in neutral grays

**Effects**: Row hover highlight, checkmark draw animations, sticky table header

**Conversion tips**:
- Always highlight YOUR row/column — don't make them search for it
- Include a free trial option in your column even if competitors don't
- Be factual; false claims destroy credibility. Cite sources for stats.

---

## Pattern 7 — Lead Magnet + Form

**Keywords**: lead, form, signup, email, magnet, freebie

**Section order**:
```
Hero → Magnet preview (mockup/cover) → Form (minimal) → Submit → Thank you state
```

**CTA placement**: Form submit button (full-width, high contrast)

**Color strategy**: Professional design, white background, `#CCCCCC` borders, brand accent on CTA only

**Effects**: Form field focus animations, real-time validation feedback, shake on error

**Conversion tips**:
- ≤ 3 fields for maximum conversion (ideally email only)
- Show a preview of the lead magnet — make them want it
- Submit button text: action verb + benefit ("Get the Free Guide", not "Submit")
- Social login reduces friction by ~30%

---

## Pattern 8 — Pricing Page + CTA

**Keywords**: pricing, plans, tiers, subscription, saas

**Section order**:
```
Hero → Pricing cards (2–4 tiers) → Feature comparison table → FAQ → CTA
```

**CTA placement**: Inside each pricing card + sticky nav CTA + bottom

**Color strategy**: Color-coded tier system: Free/grey → Starter/blue → Pro/brand → Enterprise/dark; popular plan highlighted with brand color border

**Effects**: Monthly/annual toggle with smooth height transition, hover lift on cards

**Conversion tips**:
- Offer 20–30% annual discount — show savings prominently
- Highlight the mid-tier ("Most popular" badge)
- FAQ section reduces objections — include "Can I cancel anytime?" and "What happens when I upgrade?"

---

## Pattern 9 — Video-First Hero

**Keywords**: video, hero, media, engaging, film, product

**Section order**:
```
Hero with full-bleed video → Feature highlights overlaid → Benefits → CTA
```

**CTA placement**: Video overlay center/bottom + section below

**Color strategy**: 60% dark overlay on video, brand accent for UI elements, white text throughout

**Effects**: Autoplay muted on load, parallax on scroll, fade-in for overlay text

**Conversion tips**:
- Video with captions = 86% higher engagement
- Keep video under 90 seconds; make first 5 seconds count
- Always provide a static fallback for low-bandwidth users

---

## Pattern 10 — Scroll-Triggered Storytelling

**Keywords**: storytelling, scroll, narrative, chapters, journey

**Section order**:
```
Intro scene → Chapter 1 (problem) → Chapter 2 (journey/process) → Chapter 3 (solution/outcome) → CTA
```

**CTA placement**: End of each chapter (progressive) + final CTA after conclusion

**Color strategy**: Distinct palette per chapter (transition on scroll position), dark → medium → light progression

**Effects**: GSAP ScrollTrigger pinning, parallax layers, progressive text/element reveals

**Conversion tips**:
- 3× time-on-page increase vs standard layouts
- Progress indicator (dot nav or thin progress bar) prevents disorientation
- Chapters must follow problem → journey → resolution arc — not feature lists

---

## Pattern 11 — AI Personalization

**Keywords**: ai, personalization, dynamic, adaptive, segmentation

**Section order**:
```
Dynamic hero (segment-matched) → Relevant feature subset → Tailored testimonials → CTA
```

**CTA placement**: Context-aware — placed where analytics show highest intent

**Color strategy**: Adaptive based on user segment data; consistent fallback palette

**Effects**: Dynamic content swap with fade transitions, segment-based content variations

**Conversion tips**:
- 20%+ conversion improvement possible — but requires solid analytics infrastructure
- Always define a fallback variant for unidentified users
- Test: generic vs. segment A vs. segment B before full rollout

---

## Pattern 12 — Waitlist / Coming Soon

**Keywords**: waitlist, launch, early-access, countdown, teaser

**Section order**:
```
Hero with countdown timer → Teaser content (blurred/locked) → Email form → Social proof (waitlist count)
```

**CTA placement**: Email form above the fold + sticky banner

**Color strategy**: Dark background + brand accent, urgency indicators (red countdown numbers)

**Effects**: Countdown timer animation, confetti on signup, form validation feedback

**Conversion tips**:
- Show live waitlist count ("2,847 people waiting") — social proof + FOMO
- Referral program: "Move up the list by referring 3 friends"
- Teaser content (blurred preview) increases curiosity-driven signups

---

## Pattern 13 — Comparison Table Focus

**Keywords**: comparison, versus, features, matrix, differentiation

**Section order**:
```
Hero → Problem statement → Feature matrix (you vs. 2–3 competitors) → Deep-dive sections → CTA
```

**CTA placement**: After comparison table (in highlighted column) + page bottom

**Color strategy**: Accent/green for your checkmarks, neutral gray for competitors, white/light row alternation

**Effects**: Row hover highlight, animated checkmark reveals, sticky table header on scroll

**Conversion tips**:
- 35% higher conversion when highlighting clear superiority
- Be factual — cite sources or link to benchmark data
- Deep-dive section allows users to verify table claims

---

## Pattern 14 — Pricing-Focused Landing

```

**CTA placement**: Inside each card + sticky nav CTA + page bottom

**Color strategy**: Popular plan highlighted (brand border + badge), color-coded tier system

**Effects**: Monthly/annual billing toggle, card hover lift, FAQ accordion

**Conversion tips**:
- Mid-tier "Most popular" badge drives 40–60% of conversions
- Annual discount (20–30%) displayed as $ saved per year, not just %
- FAQ must address cancellation, upgrade/downgrade, and data ownership

---

**Effects**: Device mockup rotation on scroll, screenshot slider, star rating animation

**Conversion tips**:

---

**Keywords**: faq, documentation, help, support, knowledge-base

**Section order**:
```
Hero with search bar → Category navigation → Accordion FAQ sections → Related articles → Contact CTA

**Effects**: Real-time Three.js/WebGL rendering, material/color swap, 360° rotation, zoom

---

**Section order**:
```
Prompt/input hero → Generated preview → How it works → Value proof → CTA
```

**Section order**:
```
Hero → Feature grid (4–6 items) → Use case scenarios → Social proof → CTA
```

- Social proof after features, not before (feature comprehension first)

---

## Pattern 32 — Hero-Centric Design

**Keywords**: hero-centric, hero-first, immersive-hero, visual-impact

**Section order**:
```
Full-bleed hero (60–80% viewport) → Value prop strip → Benefit/proof row → Primary CTA
```

**CTA placement**: Hero dominant (centered or lower-third) + sticky nav

**Color strategy**: High-impact hero visual, minimal text, 7:1 contrast ratio on CTA

**Effects**: Parallax on hero image/video, pulse/glow animation on CTA on scroll entry

**Conversion tips**:
- 60–80% of viewport should be hero — commit to it
- ONE primary CTA — no secondary options in hero
- Hero copy: max 8 words headline + 1 sentence sub

---

## Pattern 33 — Trust & Authority

**Keywords**: trust, authority, credibility, compliance, enterprise

**Section order**:
```
Hero (mission/statement) → Proof row (logos + certs + stats) → Solution overview → CTA path
```

**CTA placement**: "Contact Sales" or "Get a Quote" as primary + demo request secondary

**Color strategy**: Navy/grey palette, trust blue accents, brand accent ONLY on CTA

**Effects**: Logo carousel (client logos), animated stat counters, testimonial carousel

**Conversion tips**:
- Security/compliance badges in hero (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR)
- Case study links alongside stats — let them verify
- Transparent pricing or "pricing on request" must be clear — ambiguity kills enterprise trust

---

## Pattern 34 — Real-Time / Operations

**Keywords**: real-time, operations, dashboard, monitoring, status

**Section order**:
```
Hero (product + live data preview) → Key metrics/indicators → How it works → CTA
```

**CTA placement**: Primary in nav ("Start Monitoring") + after metrics section

**Color strategy**: Dark/neutral background, green/amber/red status colors, minimal decoration

**Effects**: Live ticker animations, status pulse indicators, real-time number counters

**Conversion tips**:
- Demo/sandbox link is the most effective CTA for ops tools
- Show real (or realistic demo) live data — static screenshots kill credibility
- Uptime/reliability stats (e.g., "99.99% uptime") are the primary trust signal

---

## CTA Placement Rules (Cross-Pattern)

Place CTAs in exactly 3 zones for optimal conversion:

1. **Hero section** — immediate visibility (sticky nav variant)
2. **Post-feature/proof reveal** — after value comprehension
3. **Page bottom** — final catch for scrollers

Additional rules:
- Sticky navbar CTA: persistent, 20–30% smaller than section CTAs, same color
- CTAs before social proof underperform — always lead with proof, then ask
- CTA text: verb-first ("Start", "Get", "Try", "Join") + benefit noun — never "Submit" or "Click Here"
- Mobile: sticky bottom CTA bar in addition to in-content CTAs

---

## Social Proof Formulas

| Type | Spec | Placement |
|------|------|-----------|
| Testimonials | 3–5 cards, photo + name + role + company | Before nearest CTA |
| Logo bar | 5–8 client logos, grayscale, single row | Hero lower section |
| Stats | 3 metrics (users, uptime, rating), counter animation | Post-feature or hero strip |
| Star rating | Score + count + source platform | Review pages, hero badge |
| Case studies | Title + metric outcome + link | After stats, before CTA |

---

## Form Conversion Rules

- ≤ 3 fields = maximum conversion; every additional field costs ~10% conversion
- Single-column layout always
- Real-time validation on blur (not on keystroke)
- Error state: red border + message below field (never above)
- Submit button: full-width, high contrast, verb + noun ("Get My Free Guide")
- Social login reduces friction by ~30% — offer where appropriate
- Progress indicator for multi-step forms (show step X of Y)

---

## Mobile Optimization Rules

- Reduce animation intensity by 2 levels on mobile (check `prefers-reduced-motion`)
- Stack all grid/flex layouts to single-column below 768px
- Touch targets: 48px minimum (44px Apple HIG / 48dp Material Design)
- Sticky bottom CTA bar (not just top nav)
- Reduce hero headline to `text-3xl` / `text-4xl` (clamp `1.75rem`–`2.5rem`)
- Disable parallax effects on mobile (performance + motion sensitivity)

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Multiple competing CTAs in one viewport | Splits attention, reduces clarity | One primary CTA per viewport section |
| "Learn More" as primary CTA | Too vague, no commitment | Action verb + benefit ("See How It Works") |
| Hero without clear value prop | Users leave in < 5s | Headline = who it's for + what it does |
| Stock photography in hero | Erodes trust immediately | Product screenshots, real team, custom illustrations |
| Text walls without visual breaks | Skimmers leave | Max 3 sentences per block; add icons/images |
| No social proof above fold | Trust not established before CTA | Logo bar or rating badge in hero |
| Testimonials after CTA | Proof too late | Always testimonials → CTA, not reverse |
| Form with > 5 fields | Conversion drops sharply | Remove non-essential fields ruthlessly |
