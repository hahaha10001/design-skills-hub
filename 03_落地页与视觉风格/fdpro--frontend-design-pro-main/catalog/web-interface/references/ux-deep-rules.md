| `state-transition` | State changes (hover/expanded/collapsed) must animate, not snap | |
| `continuity` | Page transitions maintain spatial continuity (shared element, directional slide) | Apple HIG |
| `hierarchy-motion` | Enter from below = deeper level; exit upward = going back | MD |
| `interruptible` | All animations must be interruptible — user gesture cancels immediately | Apple HIG |

| `scale-feedback` | Subtle scale **0.95–1.05** on press for tappable cards/buttons | HIG, MD |
| `gesture-feedback` | Drag/swipe/pinch must provide real-time visual response tracking the finger | MD |
| `opacity-threshold` | Fading elements: don't linger below 0.2 opacity — fade fully or stay visible | |

Entry (modal, dropdown)    → 250ms   ease-out
Exit (modal, dropdown)     → 150ms   ease-in   (60% of entry)
Page transition            → 300ms   spring
Complex / choreographed    → 400ms   ease-in-out
Stagger per child item     → 40ms    (30–50ms range)
Never exceed               → 500ms
```

## Cross-Cutting Rules

### What this file is vs ux-guidelines.md

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ux-guidelines.md` | High-level design principles and anti-patterns (why) |
| `ux-deep-rules.md` | Platform-specific implementation rules with citations (how) |

### When to load this file
- Auditing existing UI for violations
- Building any component that involves touch targets, animation, or form states
- Verifying chart accessibility
- Checking navigation architecture against HIG/MD standards
- Pre-delivery checklist for mobile or native-adjacent web apps

## Vercel additions (web-interface-guidelines)

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| `form-autocomplete-off` | `autocomplete="off"` on non-auth fields so password managers don't trigger on unrelated inputs |
| `form-unsaved-warning` | Warn before navigating away with unsaved changes (`beforeunload` or router guard) |
| `form-placeholder-pattern` | Placeholders end with `…` and show an example pattern (`name@company.com…`) — never restate the label |
| `form-no-paste-block` | Never `onPaste` + `preventDefault` — breaks password managers and 2FA codes |
| `img-explicit-dimensions` | `<img>` needs explicit `width`/`height` (or `fill`) — prevents CLS |
| `img-loading-priority` | Below fold `loading="lazy"`; above-fold critical `priority` / `fetchpriority="high"` |

---

## Scroll-list & micro-state polish (ibelick playbook)

Small rules that a generated UI almost always gets flat-footed. Each is a
transition or an edge treatment, not a layout decision.

| Rule | Spec |
|---|---|
| `scroll-edge-fade` | Where a scroll container clips its content, fade the clipped edge with a `mask-image` linear-gradient (≈24–40px) rather than a hard cut — signals "more here" without depending on a visible scrollbar |
| `peek-next-item` | Horizontal carousels and snap rows leave **16–32px** of the next item visible at the container edge, so it reads as scrollable at rest |
| `full-width-button-inset` | "Full-width" buttons stop at the page margin (container padding / `px-4`), never flush to the viewport edge — edge-to-edge reads as a system bar, not a control |
| `icon-state-crossfade` | Icon swaps (menu↔close, play↔pause, chevron flip) crossfade on `opacity` with a small `scale` and an optional ≤4px `blur` over ≈150ms — never an instant swap. A specific case of `fade-crossfade` |
| `label-change-blur` | Text that changes in place (a live count, a status word) transitions through a brief blur (≈120ms, ≤4px) so it registers as a change rather than a flicker. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` — snap instead |

The two blur rules stay inside the animated-blur ceiling in
`animations/references/animation-pitfalls.md` (≤8px, radius held constant or the
element pre-blurred) and are motion, not the decorative blur `blur-purpose`
forbids.

## Sources

Sections 1–10, Cross-Cutting Rules and the Priority Matrix are from
`nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill` (`quick-reference.md`), as the
top-of-file note records; the Vercel additions are from
`vercel/web-interface-guidelines`.

**Scroll-list & micro-state polish** was folded in on 2026-09-02 from
`ibelick/ui-skills` (`playbook.md` — MIT, © Julien Thibeaut), five of its ~47
numbered lessons. Integration type: fold. What changed on the way in: each
lesson is compressed to this file's one-line rule form with a stable rule id;
the two blur lessons are tied to the animated-blur ceiling in
`animation-pitfalls.md` and given a reduced-motion fallback the source does not
state; the sixth candidate (tooltip warm-up) folded into
`animations/references/animation-framework.md` instead. Playbook items already
covered by `interaction-patterns.md`, `motion-budget.md` or the anti-slop wall
were not carried.
