# DESIGN.md Parser Reference

Auto-loaded when a `DESIGN.md` file is present in the project root. No explicit shortcode is required — the skill detects the file and activates this parsing pipeline automatically.

## Purpose

This reference tells the skill HOW to parse a user-provided `DESIGN.md` file and inject its design tokens into the generated component. The `DESIGN.md` format follows Google Stitch's semantic design language — a mix of descriptive natural-language intent and precise numeric values. See `landing-pages/references/stitch-design.md` for the full Stitch format specification.

When a `DESIGN.md` is present, every token it defines takes precedence over the skill's built-in defaults. The parser is responsible for:

1. Detecting and normalising section headings (case-insensitive, synonym-aware)
2. Extracting typed values (colors, fonts, sizes, durations, easings, dials)
3. Converting all color representations to OKLCH before injection
4. Writing extracted tokens into the component's `@theme` block (Tailwind v4) or equivalent CSS custom-property block
5. Skipping any section that is absent rather than erroring

---

## Accepted Heading Variants

The parser matches headings case-insensitively and trims surrounding whitespace. Any of the synonyms below is treated as equivalent to the canonical section name.

| Canonical Name | Accepted Heading Variants |
|---|---|
| **Color** | `Color Palette`, `Colors`, `Palette`, `Brand Colors`, `Color System` |
| **Typography** | `Typography`, `Fonts`, `Type Scale`, `Typeface`, `Font Stack` |
| **Spacing** | `Spacing`, `Layout`, `Grid`, `Space Scale`, `Spacing Scale` |
| **Motion** | `Motion`, `Animation`, `Transitions`, `Timing`, `Motion Design` |
| **Rules** | `Do's and Don'ts`, `Rules`, `Guidelines`, `Constraints`, `Design Rules`, `Responsive Behavior`, `Agent Prompt Guide`, `Elevation & Depth`, `Depth & Elevation`, `Elevation`, `Shadows`, `Border Radius`, `Components`, `Shapes`, `Iteration Guide`, `Known Gaps` |
| **Atmosphere** | `Atmosphere`, `Tone`, `Mood`, `Aesthetic`, `Dials`, `Overview` |

## Matching logic

**Match on whole-word containment, never on string equality.** Five steps:

1. Strip leading `#` characters (any heading level), lowercase, reduce punctuation to spaces, split into words.
2. **Drop a leading list number.** `1.`, `2)`, `03 —` — this step alone recovers most of what the table used to miss.
3. Fold a trailing plural: `components` → `component`, so a synonym matches either form.
4. **Veto the tooling sections.** If any word is `configuration · config · install · installation · setup · import · assets · credits · license · changelog · roadmap · contributing · usage · resources · links · references`, drop the heading. These are real sections that carry no design values, and matching them would push a Mintlify config block into the generation prompt.
5. Otherwise route to the first channel whose synonym appears as a **contiguous run of words** anywhere in the heading. First match wins.

Step 5 is what makes the table survive a qualifier. `Animation Guidelines` contains `Animation` → Motion; `Component Patterns` and `Component Stylings` contain `Component` → Rules. Equality could not see any of them, and no amount of enumerating variants closes that class — the next document writes `Motion Guidelines`.

The extended Rules variants are sections in wide use across the ecosystem. They hold prose rather than token declarations, so they route to **Rules**, the natural-language channel that reaches the generation prompt verbatim. A heading that matches nothing is dropped in silence, which is the failure this table prevents.

The variant list was measured against the 74 files in `VoltAgent/awesome-design-md` rather than assumed, and the count corrected two mistakes:

| Heading as really written | Files | Was |
|---|---|---|
| `Elevation & Depth` | **63** | unmatched — we listed only the reversed order |
| `Depth & Elevation` | 10 | matched |
| `Overview` | 64 | unmatched |
| `Components` | 64 | unmatched |
| `Shapes` | 63 | unmatched |
| `Iteration Guide` | 50 | unmatched |
| `Known Gaps` | 43 | unmatched |

The word order is the instructive one: the table matched the spelling used by ten files and missed the one used by sixty-three, in the corpus it cites as its own justification. A synonym list that compares literal strings will have that bug wherever a heading is a coordinated pair — **list both orders**.

### Why that fix was not enough, measured the same way

Re-run over the same 74 files plus `heygen-com/hyperframes`' shipped `DESIGN.md` — 753 top-level headings — string equality dropped **95**. Whole-word matching with the veto list drops **2**, and both of those are correct (`Mintlify Configuration`, `Brand Assets`). No heading changes channel, so nothing that routed before routes differently.

The dominant cause was not exotic. **Ten of the 74 files number their sections, and a leading `1.` defeats the entire table** — including `6. Depth & Elevation`, `7. Do's and Don'ts`, `8. Responsive Behavior` and `9. Agent Prompt Guide`, the exact variants the correction above had just added. A fix measured only against unnumbered headings was invisible in a tenth of the corpus it was verified on.

The lesson generalises past this file: **when a check is corrected against a corpus, re-run it over that corpus in the shape the corpus really has** — numbered, qualified, pluralised — rather than against the clean spellings the fix was written for.

`Overview` routes to **Atmosphere** rather than Rules because it is where intent prose lives, and intent is what the atmosphere channel exists to carry. The `design.md` specification argues this is the most load-bearing section in the document: *"the quality of a generated design is determined less by the precision of its values than by how clearly the intent is described."* Dropping it was the most expensive of the seven misses.

One caveat worth stating: `Elevation & Depth` often carries literal shadow values, and there is no elevation extraction rule — those arrive as text for the model to honour, not as `--shadow-*` tokens.

---

## Extraction Rules

### Color Palette

**OKLCH values** — detect the pattern `oklch(L% C H)` or `oklch(L C H)` (with or without `%` on the lightness channel). Capture L, C, H as the canonical representation. No conversion needed.

**Hex values** — detect `#RGB`, `#RRGGBB`, or `#RRGGBBAA`. Convert to an OKLCH approximation using the standard sRGB → Linear sRGB → XYZ D65 → Oklab → OKLCH pipeline. Round L to two decimal places, C to three, H to one. Never emit a raw hex value into the `@theme` block.

**Role mapping** — after extraction, map each color to one of these semantic roles based on the label or descriptive text accompanying the value in DESIGN.md:

| Semantic Role | Token Name | Matching Keywords |
|---|---|---|
| Primary action / brand | `--color-primary` | primary, brand, accent CTA, key |
| Secondary action | `--color-secondary` | secondary, supporting |
| Page surface / background | `--color-surface` | surface, background, base, bg |
| Elevated surface | `--color-surface-raised` | raised, card, elevated, panel |
| Body text | `--color-text` | text, foreground, body, copy |
| Muted / subdued text | `--color-text-muted` | muted, subtle, meta, dim, secondary text |
| Border / divider | `--color-border` | border, divider, separator, stroke |
| Accent / highlight | `--color-accent` | accent, highlight, pop |

If a color's label does not match any keyword list, infer the role from positional order: first extracted color → `primary`, second → `secondary`, third → `surface`, fourth → `text`, and so on.

**Override rule** — DESIGN.md color values overwrite the corresponding token in the `@theme` block. Skill defaults for any role not mentioned in DESIGN.md are kept intact.

---

### Typography

Detect font names from any of these patterns (case-insensitive):

- `font-family: 'Font Name', fallback;`
- `font-family: Font Name;`
- `Font: Font Name`
- `Display font: Font Name`
- `Body font: Font Name`
- `Heading font: Font Name`

Extract the primary font name (strip quotes). If two distinct fonts are detected (display + body), map the first to `--font-display` and the second to `--font-sans`. If only one font is present, apply it to `--font-sans` and derive `--font-display` from the same family.

Replace the skill's default `@import` URL and `font-family` declarations with the extracted font. If the DESIGN.md includes a full `@import` or Google Fonts URL, use it verbatim.

**Weight and size scale** — if explicit weight values (`font-weight: 500`) or a size scale (`hero: clamp(3rem, 8vw, 6rem)`) are present, extract and apply them. If absent, keep the skill's default scale.

---

### Spacing

Detect a base unit declaration such as:

- `4px base unit`
- `base: 4px`
- `spacing base: 8px`
- `--spacing-base: 4px`

Compute the full scale as multiples of the base unit (×1, ×2, ×3, ×4, ×6, ×8, ×12, ×16) and apply to padding, gap, and margin utility classes.

If a complete Tailwind spacing scale is provided (e.g. a table or list of `xs: 4px`, `sm: 8px`, …), use those values directly without computing from a base.

If neither a base unit nor a full scale is found, keep the skill's default spacing.

---

### Motion

Detect duration values from patterns such as:

- `duration: 200ms`
- `transition: 200ms`
- `fast: 120ms / standard: 250ms / slow: 400ms`
- `--duration-fast: 120ms`

Map to `--duration-fast`, `--duration-base`, `--duration-slow` tokens.

Detect easing values from:

- `ease: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`
- `easing: ease-in-out`
- Named easing tokens: `--ease-spring`, `--ease-smooth`

Map to `transition-timing-function` values.

**Non-negotiable constraint** — regardless of what DESIGN.md specifies, never remove or override `prefers-reduced-motion` media query guards. Motion tokens set by DESIGN.md apply only inside contexts where reduced motion is not requested.

---

### Dials / Atmosphere

Detect the following dial declarations anywhere in the Atmosphere / Dials section or the Visual Theme section:

| Dial | Aliases | Token |
|---|---|---|
| Design Variance | `DESIGN_VARIANCE`, `DV`, `Variance` | `--dial-variance` |
| Motion Intensity | `MOTION_INTENSITY`, `MI`, `Motion` | `--dial-motion` |
| Visual Density | `VISUAL_DENSITY`, `VD`, `Density` | `--dial-density` |

Accepted formats: `DV: 7`, `Variance: 7/10`, `DESIGN_VARIANCE=7`. Normalise to an integer 1–10. If a value falls outside that range, clamp it.

Extracted dial values override the classify-stage dial defaults set by the shortcode or skill configuration.

---

## Injection Contract

After all extraction is complete, inject resolved tokens into the component's `@theme` block. Tokens derived from DESIGN.md are annotated with a `/* from DESIGN.md */` comment so downstream maintainers can trace the origin.

```css
@theme {
  /* Colors — from DESIGN.md */
  --color-primary:       oklch(55% 0.18 264);   /* from DESIGN.md */
  --color-secondary:     oklch(62% 0.12 220);   /* from DESIGN.md */
  --color-surface:       oklch(99% 0.004 255);  /* from DESIGN.md */
  --color-surface-raised: oklch(97% 0.006 255); /* from DESIGN.md */
  --color-text:          oklch(18% 0.02 260);   /* from DESIGN.md */
  --color-text-muted:    oklch(48% 0.02 260);   /* from DESIGN.md */
  --color-border:        oklch(88% 0.01 260);   /* from DESIGN.md */
  --color-accent:        oklch(68% 0.22 340);   /* from DESIGN.md */

  /* Typography — from DESIGN.md */
  --font-sans:           'Geist', sans-serif;   /* from DESIGN.md */
  --font-display:        'Geist', sans-serif;   /* from DESIGN.md */

  /* Spacing — from DESIGN.md */
  --spacing-base:        4px;                   /* from DESIGN.md */

  /* Motion — from DESIGN.md */
  --duration-fast:       120ms;                 /* from DESIGN.md */
  --duration-base:       240ms;                 /* from DESIGN.md */
  --duration-slow:       400ms;                 /* from DESIGN.md */
}
```

Tokens NOT mentioned in DESIGN.md retain the skill's defaults and receive no comment annotation. Do not duplicate default tokens inside the `@theme` block — only write the overrides.

For projects not using Tailwind v4, inject the same tokens as standard CSS custom properties on `:root` instead of inside an `@theme` block. The token names and values are identical.

---

## Override Priority

Token values are resolved in this order (highest priority wins):

1. **DESIGN.md values** — explicit tokens extracted from the user's file
2. **Shortcode dial overrides** — any `DV=`, `MI=`, `VD=` flags passed directly in the shortcode invocation
3. **Skill defaults** — the built-in token set defined in the skill package

This means a user can always be confident their `DESIGN.md` controls the final output, while shortcode flags let them make one-off adjustments on top of that, and the skill's defaults fill any remaining gaps.

## Example: DESIGN.md Snippet → @theme Injection

### Input DESIGN.md (excerpt)

```markdown
## Color Palette

- Midnight Navy (#0F172A) — primary surface and deep background
- Electric Indigo (#6366F1) — primary brand and CTA color
- Soft Slate (#F8FAFC) — page background
- Ink (#1E293B) — all body text

## Typography

Font: Manrope
Body font: Inter

## Spacing

4px base unit

## Motion

fast: 100ms / standard: 220ms / slow: 380ms
easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)

## Dials

Variance: 6/10
Motion: 5/10
Density: 7/10
```

### Resulting @theme Injection

```css
@theme {
  /* Colors — from DESIGN.md */
  --color-surface:       oklch(14% 0.026 264);  /* from DESIGN.md: Midnight Navy */
  --color-primary:       oklch(60% 0.21 277);   /* from DESIGN.md: Electric Indigo */
  --color-surface-raised: oklch(98% 0.003 255); /* from DESIGN.md: Soft Slate */
  --color-text:          oklch(18% 0.03 255);   /* from DESIGN.md: Ink */

  /* Typography — from DESIGN.md */
  --font-display:        'Manrope', sans-serif; /* from DESIGN.md */
  --font-sans:           'Inter', sans-serif;   /* from DESIGN.md */

  /* Spacing — from DESIGN.md */
  --spacing-base:        4px;                   /* from DESIGN.md */

  /* Motion — from DESIGN.md */
  --duration-fast:       100ms;                 /* from DESIGN.md */
  --duration-base:       220ms;                 /* from DESIGN.md */
  --duration-slow:       380ms;                 /* from DESIGN.md */
  --ease-default:        cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1); /* from DESIGN.md */
}
```

The hex values `#0F172A`, `#6366F1`, `#F8FAFC`, and `#1E293B` were converted to OKLCH at parse time and are never emitted raw.

## The inverse direction — deriving DESIGN.md from existing code

Everything above consumes a DESIGN.md. `google-labs-code/stitch-skills` exposes the opposite
(`stitch::extract-design-md`), which walks frontend source and emits one. Worth having as a
procedure whenever the brief is "match what is already there" and no spec exists:

1. **Read the token source before the components** — `tailwind.config`, the `@theme` block, or
   the `:root` custom properties. Declared tokens beat values inferred from usage.
2. **Count, do not sample.** Tally every colour, font size, radius and duration across the
   codebase and keep the frequent ones. A value used twice is an accident; one used forty times
   is the system.
3. **Record the scale, not the instances** — `4px base, ×1–×16` rather than every padding found.
4. **Emit the headings this parser accepts**, so the result round-trips back through it.
5. **Report conflicts rather than averaging them.** Three near-identical greys is a finding
   about the codebase, not a token to emit.

`designer-workflow.md`'s detection checklist answers *what stack is this*; this answers *what
are its design values*.

## Anti-Patterns

**Do not crash on missing sections.** If a DESIGN.md omits the Motion section entirely, skip motion extraction and keep the skill defaults. Log a debug note (e.g. `[design-md-parser] Motion section not found — using skill defaults`) but never throw.

**Do not emit hex values in @theme.** The CSS `@theme` block must contain only OKLCH (preferred), `hsl`, `rgb`, or named values. Hex strings must be converted before injection. This is a hard rule: hex in `@theme` breaks the skill's color-manipulation pipeline.

**Do not remove prefers-reduced-motion guards.** Even if DESIGN.md specifies `Motion: 10/10` or `duration: 800ms`, the generated component must always wrap motion-producing CSS inside:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  /* motion styles here */
}
```

Removing this guard to "honor" the DESIGN.md is incorrect behavior.

**Do not over-infer role mappings.** If a color label is ambiguous and does not match any keyword in the role-mapping table, use the positional fallback rather than guessing. Incorrect role assignment (e.g. mapping a background color to `--color-primary`) produces visible regressions.

**Do not duplicate tokens.** If a token appears multiple times in DESIGN.md (e.g. two entries both claiming to be `primary`), use the first occurrence and ignore subsequent duplicates. Emit a debug note for each skipped duplicate.

**Do not strip the user's descriptive text.** The Rules / Guidelines section in DESIGN.md contains natural-language design constraints (e.g. "no purple gradients", "all icons must be outline style"). These are passed through to the component generation prompt verbatim — the parser does not discard them just because they are not numeric tokens.
