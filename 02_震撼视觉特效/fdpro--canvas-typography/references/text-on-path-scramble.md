# Text on a Path, and Scramble Reveals

Two effects that share one property: the letters stay real text in the DOM, so
neither costs anything in accessibility if built correctly, and both become
inaccessible the moment they are moved onto a canvas.

## Text on a path — use SVG

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 600 200" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false">
  <path id="arc" d="M 20 160 Q 300 20 580 160" fill="none" />
  <text>
    <textPath href="#arc" startOffset="50%" text-anchor="middle">
      Durable execution
    </textPath>
  </text>
</svg>
<span class="sr-only">Durable execution</span>
```

`<textPath>` is the whole feature. The browser handles spacing, kerning and
rotation along the curve, and the text remains selectable and readable by
assistive technology — provided you give the `<svg>` an accessible name via
`<title>`, or mark it `aria-hidden` and put the string in the DOM alongside, as
above. Do not do both; a duplicated name is read twice.

`startOffset` positions the run along the path; with `text-anchor="middle"`,
`50%` centres it. `side="right"` flips text to the inside of a curve, which is
what you want for the lower half of a circular badge — otherwise it renders
upside down.

The path must have an `id` and live in the same document. Referencing a path in
an external file works in no browser worth supporting.

### When you genuinely need canvas

Per-character control the layout engine will not give you — each glyph on its own
timeline, or a path that changes per frame:

```ts
const path = svgPathElement;
const len = path.getTotalLength();

let travelled = 0;
for (const ch of text) {
  const w = ctx.measureText(ch).width;
  const pt = path.getPointAtLength(travelled + w / 2);
  const ahead = path.getPointAtLength(Math.min(travelled + w / 2 + 1, len));
  const angle = Math.atan2(ahead.y - pt.y, ahead.x - pt.x);

  ctx.save();
  ctx.translate(pt.x, pt.y);
  ctx.rotate(angle);
  ctx.fillText(ch, -w / 2, 0);
  ctx.restore();
  travelled += w;
}
```

`getPointAtLength` on a detached, never-rendered `<path>` works and is the usual
way to do this — the element does not need to be visible, only in the document.

Advance by each glyph's own measured width, not by `total / count`. Fixed
advances space `l` and `W` identically, which looks wrong immediately.

The tangent comes from sampling one unit ahead. Sampling *behind* lags the
rotation by a glyph and the text appears to peel off the curve.

Cache `getTotalLength()`. It is not free and the path rarely changes.

## Scramble / decode

Each character cycles through random glyphs, then locks to its final value. The
effect works because of the stagger — simultaneous resolution reads as a flicker.

**Split on graphemes, not code points.** `[...target]` and `target.split("")`
are both wrong, just at different thresholds: `split("")` tears surrogate pairs
in half and renders a pair of replacement characters, and spreading fixes that
but still splits a *grapheme cluster* into its parts. So `é` written as `e` +
U+0301 scrambles as two slots and drops its accent onto whatever glyph the RNG
picked; `👨‍👩‍👧` explodes into three people and two joiners; a flag becomes two
letters. `Intl.Segmenter` is the primitive that gets this right, and it is a
browser built-in — no dependency, no table to ship.

```ts
const CHARS = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789";

interface Slot { to: string; start: number; end: number; shown: string }

const segmenter = new Intl.Segmenter(undefined, { granularity: "grapheme" });
const graphemes = (s: string) => Array.from(segmenter.segment(s), (g) => g.segment);

// Build once, per reveal:
const slots: Slot[] = graphemes(target).map((to, i) => ({
  to,
  start: i * 40,              // stagger — this is the whole effect
  end: i * 40 + 260 + Math.random() * 200,
  shown: "",
}));
```

Construct the segmenter once and hoist it — it is not free per call, and a
reveal that rebuilds it every frame will show up in a profile. Passing
`undefined` as the locale takes the runtime's own, which is what you want here:
grapheme boundaries are near-locale-invariant, and hardcoding `"en"` only
misreports intent.

One consequence worth stating, since it changes what the effect *means*: a slot
now holds a cluster rather than a character, so the placeholder glyph swapped in
during the scramble is one narrow Latin character standing in for something that
may be much wider. On CJK or emoji targets the line visibly reflows as it
resolves. Draw each slot at a fixed advance measured from the final text if that
matters — see the metrics section in `canvas-2d-typography.md`.

Per frame, advance an elapsed clock and resolve each slot:

```ts
for (const s of slots) {
  if (elapsed >= s.end) s.shown = s.to;
  else if (elapsed >= s.start) s.shown = CHARS[(Math.random() * CHARS.length) | 0];
  else s.shown = "";
}
setText(slots.map((s) => s.shown).join(""));
```

Drive `elapsed` from the RAF timestamp. `setInterval` at 30ms drifts against the
display, keeps running in a hidden tab, and cannot be cancelled on a frame
boundary.

Preserve spaces and punctuation rather than scrambling them — word boundaries are
what make a half-resolved string still read as language instead of noise.

Total duration should stay under about 800ms. Longer and it stops reading as a
reveal and starts reading as a page that has not loaded.

### Layout stability

Scrambling changes glyph widths every frame, so the line reflows continuously and
drags everything below it. Two fixes:

- `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` if the content is numeric.
- Reserve the final width up front: render the resolved string in a hidden
  element and set `min-width` from it, or use a monospace face for the duration.

### Accessibility

The scrambling text must not be what a screen reader reads — a stream of random
characters announced letter by letter is actively hostile.

```html
<span aria-hidden="true">{scrambled}</span>
<span class="sr-only">{target}</span>
```

Never put `aria-live` on the scrambling element. Every intermediate frame would
be announced.

Under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, render the target string immediately and
never start the loop. Not a faster scramble — no scramble.

```ts
if (window.matchMedia("(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)").matches) {
  setText(target);
  return;
}
```

## Cleanup

Both effects hold a RAF handle, and the scramble usually holds timers too. React
effects must return a cleanup that cancels every one of them:

```ts
return () => {
  cancelAnimationFrame(raf);
  mq.removeEventListener("change", onChange);
};
```

A leaked loop calling `setState` after unmount is the classic version of this
bug: it keeps the component's whole subtree alive in memory, and in development
it surfaces as a warning that people learn to ignore.
